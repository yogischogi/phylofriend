2018-03-20
- Upgraded to 587 markers.
- Removed DYF390.1 and DYF390.2 because they are no longer
  reported by YFull.

2016-08-10
- Added the infinite alleles mutation model.
  The mutation model can be selected by the -model command
  line option.

2016-07-31
- genfiles.WritePersonsAsHTML added.
  The function writes Y-STR values in HTML format.
  The first row of the table is used as the modal haplotype.
  Depending on the distance to the modal haplotype the
  values are colored.

2016-07-17
- genetic.ReadPersonsFromCSV rewritten.
  The function now cleanly distinguishes between Family
  Tree DNA format, where multicopy marker values are
  separated by hyphens, and the traditional format, where
  each value is placed in a separate column.
  If a multicopy markers exhibits more values than
  expected, the extra values are truncated.

2016-03-22
- genetic: MarkerStatistics contains more information.
- New MarkerStatistics.Select and
  MarkerStatistics.MutationRates.

2016-03-18
- genetic: Output of marker values is no longer truncated
  to whole numbers.

2016-03-12
- New genetic.MarkerStatistics.
- genetic.isValidPalindromic returns false if one marker
  is < 0.

2016-03-08
- genetic.isValidPalindromic tests for uncertain values.

2016-03-07
- genetic.Distance ignores values < 0.

2016-03-05
- Empty values in YFull files are now allowed.
- Updated experimental mutation rates for 500 and 390
  markers.

2016-03-02
- Added DYR171.
- Fixed DYF390 bug in translationtable.

2016-03-01
- Support for multiple input files using the personsin
  option.
- Added mutation rates "12-count.txt", "37-count.txt",...
  for easy mutation counting.

2016-02-22
- Mutation model for 500 markers.
- Experimental mutation rates for 500 and 390 markers.
  The 390-average mutation rates leave out most of the
  palindromic markers.
- Updated documentation.

2016-02-21
- New order in YstrMarkerTable.
- YCAII now handled as palindromic.
- YFull input refined and tested.
- Fixed YstrMarkerTable and added new markers.

2016-02-20
- Command line parameter personsin now excepts a directory
  containing files in YFull format.
  This code is untested.

2016-02-19
- genetic.Distance: Removed special handling for DYS389i.
- Code clean up for genetic.Distance.
  The genetic distance calculation is still only valid for
  up to 111 markers, although the program uses 500 markers
  for comparison.
- Files containing mutation rates: Zero values were deleted
  for better clarity.

2016-02-18
- Bug fix: genetic.Distance

2016-02-17
- genetic: All calculations on Y-STR markers are now
  done using arrays instead of structures. This is much
  more suited for large numbers of markers than the
  previous approach.
- genfiles: JSON input/output functions were rewritten
  due to the use of arrays in the genetic package.

2016-02-14
- genetic: Added translation table for 500 markers.
  Currently this has no effect on the running program.
  In the future the calculation of genetic distances
  will be performed using arrays instead of structures.
  This will simplify the calculations but require
  additional programming for input output operations
  and debugging.

2016-02-11
Changes in program behaviour to improve usability:

- Command line parameter "nvalues" changed to "nmarkers".
  I believe this is easier to understand and to remember.

- Default value for generation time is now 1 instead of 25.
  This means that the genetic distance is computed in
  generations instead of years as default.
  A generation time of 25 years has shown to be a bad
  choice. 32 years is more appropriate.

- genetic.MutationRates had been replaced by 
  genetic.DefaultMutationRates(), a function that returns
  a set of markers where all values are set to 1. This
  makes mutation counting the default behaviour.
  The previously used 37 marker mutation rates have not
  proven to be of great value in practice.

- In the directory "mutationrates" all files containing
  marker sets of only Ones where deleted. They are now
  obsolete.

Readability improvements:

- Nmarkers has been changed to MaxMarkers.

- nValues has been changed to nMarkers in function
  definitions.
